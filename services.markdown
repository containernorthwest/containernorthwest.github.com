###Shipping services to suit your needs

&nbsp;  
**Containerizing**  
We’ll load your heavy equipment and parts into containers for safe international shipment. We also check hydraulic lines to avoid leakage during transit.

**Flat rack transportation**  
Flat rack containers are designed to transport cargo larger than the dimensions available in other heavy duty shipping containers. A certified marine surveyor will prepare the cargo to ensure flat rack loading is accepted by the carrier.

**Roll-on/Roll-off service**  
We can assist you with roll-on/roll-off shipping services for wheeled equipment. In-house lowboy service is available on request.

**Drayage**  
We provide drayage for 20’, 40’, or 45’ containers, as well as over-dimensional flat rack loads to the ports of Seattle, Tacoma and Portland.

**Storage**  
Your cargo can be stored for shipping at our secure yard in Tacoma.
